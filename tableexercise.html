                <td>I like box Turtles because they are small and they are usally a good pet.</td>
                <td>It depends on your needs. If you want a turtle that is good for almost anything that it might be worth it to.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Sea Turtle</td>
                <td>I like Sea Turtles because everyone knows that Sea Turtles are the best kind of Turtle.</td>
                <td>You most likely should not get one because they are very large and trying to care for one is very hard. Either way it is very fun and if you are up to the task it is fun to do.</td>
